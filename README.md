In this challenge, I was assigned the task of creating a Python script to visualize weather for over 500 cities throughout the world. I then created different scatter plots analyzing the latitudes of the cities versus temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. I created linear regression models from these graphs to show the relationships in both the northern and southern hemispherically located cities. The next part of the challenge was to create a heat map to display the humidities in the different cities. I then narrowed down my dataset to find the ideal weather conditions and locate the nearest hotels nearby. These locations were also plotted on the heat map to create my final project.
